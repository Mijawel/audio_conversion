# audio_conversion

This project is intended to save an audio stream from another chrome tab and convert that to a WAV file.

The wav file conversion doesn't currently work.

I am using the js package https://github.com/upadhyaypushpendra/webm-to-wav-converter
although I am open to using other packages to solve the issue as long as they are not too large (or can be loaded
in the background so as not to delay app startup, but even then I would't want more than a few MB)

This is tested on [âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.3.5, on macOS 12.6 21G115 darwin-arm, locale en-AU) 
but probably also works on older versions.

Here is a loom video showing how it works: https://www.loom.com/share/0754aa8871c245bfbef44e718fe55e3e
